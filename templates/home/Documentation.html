    Operation Planning System <strong>(OPS)</strong>: Streamlining Business Processes
    through Automation
  </h3>
  <p>
    In today's fast-paced business environment, efficiency and precision are
    paramount for success. The Operation Planning System (OPS) is a
    comprehensive web application designed to revolutionize and automate various
    aspects of business operations within our company. By integrating modules
    such as manpower, equipment, document control, planning, technical office,
    engineering, procurement, security, quality control, safety, operations,
    reporting, and automation control, OPS aims to enhance collaboration, reduce
    manual workload, and optimize resource utilization. This paper provides an
    in-depth overview of the motivation behind creating OPS and a detailed
    description of each module.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Introduction:</li>
    <p>
      The Operation Planning System (OPS) is developed to address the challenges
      posed by manual and time-consuming processes in our company. The primary
      goal is to streamline operations, improve decision-making, and boost overall
      productivity. OPS is built on a foundation of high-level security features
      and a robust PostgreSQL database management system, ensuring the
      confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.
